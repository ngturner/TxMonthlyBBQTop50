                "Story": "Last year a few young pitmasters joined forces to take an abandoned building on the southeast side of Fort Worth and create their ideal of a modern barbecue joint. Though they lacked the decades of experience typical of many top-flight cooks, this band of barbecue wunderkinder had worked at some of the best joints in Texas (Franklin, La Barbecue, Micklethwait, Valentina’s). But just after opening, in February 2020, the dining room was forced to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Goldee’s barely hung on as a take-out operation until this April, when it fully reopened. (When we recently joked to Jonny White that they should be selling more than fifteen briskets a day—compared with the hundred or so at Franklin—he replied, “It’s better than the four a day we were selling last May.”) So, what shot this modest joint into our top spot? Simply put, food that’s close to perfection. During repeated visits, we searched for weaknesses and inconsistencies, only to find, again and again, the state’s best spareribs and spectacular sausage and brisket. While many places have come to rely on the common crutches of excess—too much salt on the brisket, too much sugar on the ribs—Goldee’s demonstrates a confident restraint that belies the pitmasters’ youth. They trust the meat and the smoke more than an arsenal of seasonings. That attention doesn’t waver when it comes to sides, especially the peppery cheese grits and the mustard-heavy pork hash. And then there are culinary surprises such as Nupohn Inthanousay’s Laotian sausage: take a chunk, mash it into a bit of sticky rice, and dunk the combo into the spicy-sour jeow som sauce. Your eyes will open wide as you gaze at the new horizons of Texas barbecue.",

The joint’s ethos is aptly summed up in its slogan: “New School BBQ, Old School Service.” At LeRoy and Lewis, the new-school approach means Evan LeRoy eschews pork ribs (though on Saturdays he does offer “bacon ribs”—massive pork ribs with the belly still attached) and turkey (except around Thanksgiving) and serves brisket only on Saturdays and Sundays. (Said brisket is Akaushi, by the way, and a good reason for a weekend visit.) The regular offerings are excellent, though, two of the best being glistening, succulent smoked barbacoa and luxurious sliced beef cheeks. There’s also pulled whole hog and salty whole hog sausage with a handmade, country look. Also on tap: unusual sides such as sassy kimchi, vinegary braised cabbage and sausage, and terrific pork hash (a.k.a. rice with a meaty gravy). If you don’t have room after all that, know that the cheddar cheesecake with a dab of apple butter is worth a return visit. Serious backyard cooks can sign up online for a weekend at “New School BBQ University” ($1,500, though there’s also a more affordable option of online videos), where they’ll learn techniques such as the foil-boat wrap method, which produces a magnificently crunchy crust on the brisket. Many of the classes take place at Cosmic Coffee + Beer Garden, where the truck has been parked since it opened, four years ago.",

The specials go fast, so get here early if you want anything beyond the standard menu (which, for the record, is hardly a consolation prize). The many varieties of house-made sausages are impeccably crafted, as is the Wagyu brisket, which exhibits the perfect balance of smoke, seasoning, and beefy flavor. The pulled pork is sui generis for Texas because the Davids bought a North Carolina whole hog cooker; the result is tangy, moist, and richer than meat taken just from the shoulder. It’s available daily, and each serving is topped with cracklins. The large dining room, with its friendly vibe and many photos of loyal customers, exudes confidence and conviviality.",

The sweet, pink pulled pork could star in a holiday picnic. As for the homemade sides—classic potato salad, slaw, and pinto beans—tradition rules. Same with desserts (individual pies such as pecan and key lime), baked by a local purveyor. After twelve years in business, Franklin Barbecue still has the magic, thanks to fanatical smoke master Aaron Franklin, who doesn’t really cook much anymore but supervises all smoking operations. The charismatic native Texan made his mark on the Austin scene in 2009, achieving rock-star status and inspiring young, urban would-be pitmasters statewide. So popular was his little joint that three-hour waits in line were routine. In 2013 and 2017, it captured the number one and number two spots, respectively, on our Top 50 list. But even as the Franklin phenomenon continued unabated—he wrote two cookbooks, won a James Beard Award, and helped start an Austin food and music festival—the newcomers were busy introducing novel dishes, drawing inspiration from far afield, and becoming agents of change themselves. Franklin’s drop into the bottom half of our top ten isn’t a sign that the beloved establishment has diminished—no one does the traditional barbecue lineup better. But it is a sign that the new wave is reshaping the scene in ways we couldn’t have imagined a few short years ago.",

Instead, grab a free beer from the cooler and peruse the desserts on display. Strawberry cake, Texas sheet cake, and no fewer than two versions of pecan pie are available most days. Beef ribs sell out quickly, but you’ll be just as satisfied with the fatty brisket, especially the decadent burnt ends. Saucy pork ribs have gotten trendy, so we appreciate the more subtle seasoning on these perfectly smoked St. Louis–cut ribs. The same could be said of the German smoked sausage. Yes, there’s a spicy, cheesy version too, but the original is bursting with flavor and has the perfect snap, no gimmicks needed. For sides, fresh green beans and green-chile cheese grits are hard to beat, though you shouldn’t ignore the cornbread. For a change of pace, look for the occasional smoked prime rib dinners (so popular you’ll need a reservation). And if you’re in the market for a massive new smoker, Arnis will weld one for you in his shop next door.",

Those peaceful days came to an abrupt halt in 2008, when this magazine ranked the tiny, rustic place number one on our Top 50 list. The renown that followed sparked 45-minute waits in line—just ask “Joe from Wisconsin”—and turned Snow’s expert pitmaster Tootsie Tomanetz into a barbecue celebrity. Her grandmotherly face drew national media coverage, and in 2013 and 2017, Snow’s made our top two again. But it wasn’t until 2020, when the Netflix series Chef ’s Table: BBQ aired a moving and beautifully shot tribute, that Snow’s fame truly went global. Now barbecue hounds hailing from Guatemala to Kenya sleep in lawn chairs under the property’s trees on Friday nights to be first in line the next morning. If they’re lucky, they might get to snap a picture with Tomanetz, skilled co-pitmaster Clay Cowgill, or affable owners Kerry and Kim Bexley. Those devotees are rewarded with smoked meats as good as any in the country, along with a traditional lineup of sides and banana pudding for dessert. So why, then, has Snow’s slipped a few spots down on our list? For the same reason Franklin has: as much as we love the place, the Texas barbecue game has changed profoundly.

Now the truck is gone in favor of a permanent space that includes a covered patio. Massive yet tender spareribs are glazed with sweet barbecue sauce, while the moist smoked turkey has a spicy kick. House-made sausages burst with juice, and the pork belly burnt ends, now a Cowtown barbecue staple, are sweet, sticky, fatty morsels that eat like meat candy. Even more over-the-top are the pork belly poppers: burnt ends stuffed inside jalapeño halves along with a bit of cream cheese, then wrapped in bacon. The sensation of biting through the crisp bacon into the meltingly tender cube of pork and fat beneath is pure heaven. But the showstopper is the brisket elote. Layers of creamed corn, chopped brisket, queso fresco, cilantro, and hot sauce are a full meal in a cup.

Yep, could be seventy or eighty dollars.” She slapped the counter, turned and pulled the rib from the warmer, and dropped it onto a tray, causing the rendered fat and tender beef to roll like waves on an angry sea. The first salty, buttery bite made clear that this is one of the best pieces of smoked meat you’ll find anywhere. The brisket, sliced as thick as a New York strip, and the all-beef sausage, which audibly snaps (and drenches your chin) when bitten, are also near-perfect specimens. And that’s why few things are more sacred in Texas barbecue than a meal at Louie Mueller.",

If you’ve come to this joint, the last in the state allowed to cook its meat in an underground pit, you surely aren’t there for standard Middle American fare. The brisket may not be top-notch, but it’s worth trying when wrapped in a tortilla and topped with salsa verde, and the carnitas are tender and satiating. The real draw, though, is the barbacoa de cabeza; Vera’s serves every part of the cow’s head. Even the least adventurous will enjoy the cheek (cachete), and the more adventurous can try tongue (lengua) and eyes (ojos). How do you like them apples?",

Even better is the Maxi, a sandwich with sliced sausage and chopped brisket, whose rough, inky-black bark is nicely juxtaposed with a pink-hued smoke ring. The meat is then topped with thick pickle disks and served in a soft, buttery bun. Finish with a slice of the luscious, scratch-made sweet potato pie. ",

But Miller’s represents decades of slow growth. Its first briskets, in true Central Texas style, were cooked in a small smoker in the alley beside the family’s taxidermy shop, and the pies still come mostly from family recipes baked by the matriarch, “Momma” Miller, and her team. The meat, however, is the true testament to old-school barbecue cred. There are a handful of departures from the Texas trinity, but the brisket is the star, with a nice black crust that gives way to fat that’s been rendered almost to butter.",

If, like that dinosaur, you crave sausage, you’ll want to try the original, jalapeño, and chipotle versions. They go great with the spicy dill pickles, and it’s hard to beat the flavor combination of a La Barbecue brisket burnt end and a forkful of the sweet-pepper-and-cucumber kimchi.

                "Story": "During a recent weekday lunch visit, we joined the many dude duos who had crowded the parking lot with their vehicles. “You spend your whole life trying to figure your wife out,” we heard one man say to another; others were eating in reverent silence. In line, we’d asked pitmaster Jeffery Hobbs what the specialty was. “Well, we’re kinda known for all of it,” he said. We thought it was a standard marketing line from a proud meat dad until we tried all of it. The sausage and turkey were heavily smoky; neither needed the sauce, which was deep red and not too sweet, but they were both perfect vessels for it. The pork ribs were rich and peppery, and the meat clung to the bone in just the right fashion. As for the brisket, we ordered from the fatty side and were surprised by how well the crust hung onto the meat in spite of the layer of fat between the two. Upon our first bite, we let out a vulgar little moan. ",

We walked to the table with a plate of meats and a side we were particularly excited about: the brisket mac and cheese. Buttery in texture and color, with a truly cheesy flavor, the mac could have stood alone. But with a generous serving of chopped brisket atop it? We would have been happy with that as our whole meal. The sliced brisket was also a dream, boasting a beautiful smoke ring, well-peppered bark, and melty fat. The sausage was juicy, with a casing that snapped immediately and then gave way to the sweet and salty flavor of its dense interior. The turkey delighted too, packing a bit of peppery punch. And the house-made barbecue sauce was distinctive: a little sweet, undeniably tangy, and more smoky than peppery.

Phil Baker and son Wayne, who opened their spot in a spacious metal building along a highway six years ago, use charcoal instead of wood to smoke all the meats except for the sausage (the result: a flavor more akin to grilled than smoked). “We’re one of the few places that does that,” an employee boasted as she took our order.

To wit: the Wednesday we ventured over, we opted for the phenomenal char siu banh mi, smoky Gouda mac and cheese, a piquant jalapeño coleslaw, and the knockout brisket fried rice.

The spicy gochujang pork ribs are marinated, smoked, and then flame-blasted with a butane torch right before being served with a topping of green onions and toasted sesame seeds. And it turns out that the house-made kimchi rivals Topo Chico as the perfect fizzy palate cleanser between bites. As for dessert, if you order the lemon cookies, you’ll get three of them.

Then they progressed to the pop-up scene and, finally, to a home at Lola’s Trailer Park, in Fort Worth’s Cultural District. The crew plates some of the most attractive spreads in the state: a platter of artfully arranged black-bark brisket, red-hued ribs, silky white pork belly, house-made pickles, street corn, and pink pickled onions would tempt even the Instagram-averse to take a photo. Weaver’s sausage program is one of the more creative ones in the state, as evidenced by his blueberry-and-Gouda version. Adding some of the bacon brisket (pork belly cooked like brisket) is a nice way to round out your meal, which you should enjoy on the covered patio with a drink from Lola’s Saloon.",

Now running their own place, the sibling scholars are dishing out Central Texas–style barbecue that’s a study in pepper: the perfectly rendered lean brisket has a piquant bark thanks to a pepper, salt, and Season-All rub, which is also used in the pulled pork. The pork ribs’ sweet glaze offers the palate some relief, but the must-have is the sausage, spiced with salt, black pepper, cumin, garlic, cayenne, and crushed red pepper.

The “modern African American” menu is Brockway’s interpretation of dishes from various African American cuisines, such as black-eyed peas, which originated in West Africa and are a part of New Year’s traditions in the South. In this hearty version, the beans are cooked with burnt ends. A standout item is the juicy, well-seasoned chicken leg quarters.

                "Story": "The first Feges BBQ opened in Houston’s Greenway Plaza food court, in 2018, with as much emphasis on sides as smoked meats. It hasn’t slowed down since we named it one of the 25 best new barbecue joints in 2019, and a second location, with an even more ambitious menu, opened fifteen minutes away, in the Spring Branch district, earlier this year. There, fried chicken and a porcini-rubbed hanger steak join sweet-glazed pork ribs, Big Red brisket burnt ends, and juicy smoked chicken. Excellent accompaniments include the elote salad and Money Cat potatoes (imagine a potato burnt end bathed in a barbecue sauce made with Korean chile paste). But the spicy Korean greens might be the best barbecue side dish in Texas, so sop up that pot liquor with a wedge of hog-fat cornbread.",

You smell the smoke first, of course, and then you see pile upon pile of neatly stacked wood. Next comes the music: strains of the Texas Tornados’ “(Hey Baby) Que Paso” greeted us as we joined a long line of diners. By the time we made our way inside, our taste buds were primed. They were rewarded with decadently glazed “candy paint” pork ribs, snappy jalapeño-cheese sausage, and brisket that disappeared so quickly we regretted ordering only half a pound. A classic mustard potato salad and a lightly sauced red-cabbage slaw rounded out the tray, along with a divine smoked bread pudding (if it had any smoke, we couldn’t detect it). The hunting lodge–like dining room, replete with a full bar, and the festive outdoor eating area made the whole experience feel like a party you don’t want to end.",

We thanked him for his courtesy and vowed to return, considerably earlier, the next day. That’s typical of the thoughtful service you get at this sterling addition to the Central Texas barbecue pantheon. The attractively remodeled commercial building, with bare brick walls and sky-high ceilings, is the perfect place to savor brisket with an impressively thick crust covering a thin layer of translucent fat. The pork ribs are beauts too, with great texture and just a hint of sweetness. Listen as you bite into the coarse-ground sausage: you’ll hear a satisfying snap. Barbecue fans who walk on the mild side will be grateful for the exceptional smoked turkey breast, and big groups will be thrilled with the variety of sides, including the gently seasoned cowboy beans (soupy in the good old-fashioned way) and the excellent street corn pudding. At the end of the long, efficiently run counter, you’ll find an array of Instagrammable desserts. If you must choose between the Big Red tres leches cake and the chocolate cake with fudgy icing, go with the second (though it’s not available every day). And check the chalkboard for daily features, such as the huge, gloriously fatty pork steak we had one Thursday.",

Pit boss John Bates acquired a fine-dining pedigree at Austin institutions Wink and Asti, and he brings that experience and, yes, ambition to bear in everything he offers, which is why InterStellar has quickly risen to destination status. The tidy, agreeable joint is located in a massive strip mall, so just circle the parking lot until you see the two smokers. The larger one is where Bates cooks his most popular meats. The secret to his brisket is simple: salt, pepper, garlic, and obsessive heat management. For his pork ribs, he eschews the usual glaze but, knowing diners expect a little sweetness, adds brown sugar to the rub. He also smokes what he calls the Tipsy Turkey Breast, which marinates overnight in hefeweizen. The smaller smoker is reserved for experiments such as pork belly doused with a peach-tea glaze and an onion stuffed with chopped brisket, a hat tip to Bates’s dad, who threw an onion on the campfire every time he cooked outdoors. As for sides, the usual trio is rounded out with striking additions such as a tomato-and-zucchini salad and scalloped potatoes with a toasted-Parmesan crust. Our nominee for must-try dessert? The Mexican-hot-chocolate rice pudding.",

It starts with a homey atmosphere and staff who are both knowledgeable and helpful—no rushing customers through the long line here. The combination of both unconventional and classic sides makes it hard to choose (or not) between corn pudding and creamed spinach or potato salad and pinto beans. Swoon-worthy cakes are made by head pitmaster Leonard Botello’s mom, Janel, and head baker Laquita Wilkins. The three layers of the intense chocolate cake are best separated before eating, lest you devour the entire massive slice in one sitting. A selection of sauces adorns each table, from a spicy red to a vinegary mustard that pops like a hangover remedy. But we digress from the meat. Smoked by Botello and his crew, the ribs have a beet-red, satiny exterior, the perfect counterpoint to the sweet, succulent interior, which can definitely go sauce-free. Ditto the brisket, with its deep, peppery crust and just the right measure of glossy fat to bring out the best in the lush, smoky beef. Botello’s niche specialties are bold as well. Chunks of smoked brisket are stuffed into the Cajun-inspired burnt-end boudin (limited availability daily) and served with house-made hot sauce. Saturdays are for whole hog barbecue, prepared in a cooker dedicated to the job and as good as some of the Carolina versions Truth was inspired by. Get there before eleven to beat the worst of the line; visitors arriving after two will likely be disappointed.",
